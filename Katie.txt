Dear Katie,

Great job exploring the process of taking apart and repurposing a portable charger. You started by observing and drawing the exterior, and then made predictions about the internal components. As you disassembled the charger, you encountered challenges with the plastic casing and learned the importance of being careful to avoid damaging parts. Once inside, you found a circuit board, battery, and connecting wires.

During the reconstruction phase, you realized the importance of having a plan and the right materials, as you struggled to repurpose the charger with limited resources. You attempted to create a dog toy, but ultimately decided against it due to safety concerns. This exercise helped you reflect on the importance of planning, patience, and critical engagement with technology to create sustainable, repairable products.

You connected your experience to Jackson's (2014) ideas on environmentally friendly technology and shared your family's tradition of repair. Moving forward, you plan to better prepare and continue expanding your knowledge in repairing electronics. Keep up the good work and continue exploring the world of electronics repair!/

Great job this week! It's apparent that you've been focusing on button, cardboard, and debugging. These are essential skills and knowledge points that will contribute to your overall understanding of the subject.

Comparing your knowledge with other students who mentioned similar knowledge points, such as Helen, Eury, and Sadia, it's great to see that you all have a grasp on the button concept. As a suggestion, you could collaborate and discuss your experiences and challenges related to button usage, and share ideas on how to effectively incorporate buttons into your projects. This way, you can all learn from each other and enhance your understanding of this concept.

In terms of students who mentioned different knowledge points, like Xichen and Zhanlan, they focused on topics like computational thinking and dissecting. It could be beneficial for you to connect with these students and learn from their experiences. This would allow you to broaden your knowledge and gain insights into other areas that you might not have explored yet.

For students who mentioned both similar and different knowledge points, such as Ana Maria, Heidi, and Mariana, it's a great opportunity for you to engage in discussions and share your perspectives on the common topics, while also learning from their unique experiences in the different knowledge points. This type of interaction can help you build a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and foster a collaborative learning environment.

Keep up the good work, Katie! Remember that learning is a continuous process and engaging with your classmates can provide valuable insights and diverse perspectives. Don't hesitate to reach out to your peers for discussions, as well as seeking guidance and support when needed. This will not only help you grow in your learning journey but also contribute to the overall growth of the class.
