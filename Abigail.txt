<Project summary>

Thank you for sharing your experience with disassembling an electronic object for the first time. It's great to see how fascinated you were with discovering the internal parts and how it gave you a sense of fulfillment. It's interesting to learn about your background in fixing personal items and how this project helped you explore a new side of repairing and creating.

It's okay that you couldn't identify how all the parts worked; focusing on shapes and formats for your assignment was still a valuable learning experience. It's impressive how you experimented with materials and toy balance points, even though it took your final object away from your initial mock-up.

Your family's culture of avoiding breaking things and your stepson's creativity with repurposing items are thought-provoking points. It's essential to consider the environmental impact and material consumption when repairing or reusing objects.

Keep up the great work! I look forward to hearing more about your future projects and learning experiences.


<Suggestions on collaboration and exploration opportunities>

Great job this week! You did particularly well in the areas of compute, dissect, and woodshop.

When comparing your knowledge matrix to Eury, Sadia, and Helen, who mentioned some similar concepts like compute and dissect, I suggest you explore button and circuit concepts since they might be helpful in future projects. Additionally, you can collaborate with them to exchange ideas and help each other improve.

Regarding students who mentioned different knowledge concepts, such as Xichen, Zhanlan, and Katie, consider learning more about debug, molding, and aluminum respectively. Diversifying your skillset will broaden your knowledge base and benefit you in the long run.

Lastly, when comparing with students who mentioned both similar and different concepts, like Ana Maria, Heidi, and Kiki, you can exchange ideas and learn from each other. Ana Maria mentioned light source and user interview, Heidi focused on battery and recycle, and Kiki learned about cotton and heart beat sensor. Sharing knowledge and learning from each other's experiences will enrich your learning process and enhance your skills.

Keep up the great work, Inara! Looking forward to seeing your progress in the coming weeks.
