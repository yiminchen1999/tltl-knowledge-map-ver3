<Project summary>

Mariana, great job exploring two different ideas for repurposing materials! In your first idea, you attempted to create a pencil case from your daughter's tight crocs and some jeans. You cut the crocs in half, painted them, and added a zipper. Despite it not turning out as you envisioned, it's important to remember that frustration and setbacks are part of the learning process.

In your second idea, you created a waterproof planter by combining cut crocs with a discarded lamp part and crochet thread. You cut the crocs differently, made holes for the thread, and crocheted around the lamp part. You then planted beans in cotton and soil to observe their growth. This idea not only showcases your creativity but also highlights the importance of repurposing and reusing materials in a world where waste is prevalent.

Keep up the good work and continue to explore innovative ways to transform and repurpose items around you!


<Suggestions on collaboration and exploration opportunities>

Great job this week on focusing on button, compute, and elastic force! You were able to explore these concepts and apply them effectively in your work.

Compared to other students who mentioned the same knowledge as you (Eury, Sadia, and Helen), you all have a solid understanding of the button concept. However, you might want to explore circuits like Eury and Helen did to strengthen your understanding of how buttons can be implemented in practical applications. Also, consider discussing with Sadia to exchange ideas on compute and learn from each other's experience.

When comparing your work to students who mentioned different knowledge (Xichen, Zhanlan, Katie, Andrea, Inara, and Kiki), you can learn from their experiences and expand your knowledge base. For example, you could ask Katie about her work with aluminum and battery, or discuss with Inara and Kiki about their experience with disassemble and dissect. These conversations can help you expand your skillset and make your projects more versatile.

Lastly, let's look at students who mentioned both similar and different knowledge (Heidi and Ana Maria). Heidi has been working on button and elastic force like you, but she also explored temperature sensor and woodshop. Ana Maria, on the other hand, delved into compute and elastic force along with learning process and logic gate. Engaging with these students can give you valuable insights into how to combine your current knowledge with new concepts, ultimately enhancing your learning experience.

Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out to your peers for guidance and collaboration. Your continuous growth and improvement are essential for your overall success!
