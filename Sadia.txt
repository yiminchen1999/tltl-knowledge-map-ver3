<Project summary>

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the "Rethinking Repair" article and your interesting project on repurposing materials. It's great to see that you've realized the importance of repair beyond just fixing broken items and considering repurposing and reusing.

Your choice of materials for this project - mechanical pencil, pen, bottle cap, buttons, and hand sanitizer bottle - shows your creativity in using everyday items. It's impressive that you've added a wooden base and cloth to connect the springs during the process.

The tools you used, such as scissors, super glue, and needle and thread, demonstrate your resourcefulness in assembling the project. Your design sketch of the bobble toy looks promising, and I'm looking forward to seeing the video of the process.

Despite the challenges you faced with different spring sizes and the heavy sanitizer bottle, you managed to adapt and find solutions by sewing the springs to the cloth and gluing it to the base. Your suggestions for future improvements, like using same-sized springs and a heavier base, show your commitment to learning and growth.


<Suggestions on collaboration and exploration opportunities>

First of all, great job on demonstrating your knowledge in casting, woodshop, and trial-and-error this week! It's always good to see students exploring new concepts and applying them in their work.

Comparing your knowledge matrix with Eury, who also mentioned casting, it seems that both of you are on the right track. However, Eury also mentioned button and brainstorming. I would suggest you to engage in more brainstorming sessions to generate creative ideas, and explore the use of buttons in your projects as they can add interactive elements to your designs.

When comparing your knowledge matrix with students like Helen and Xichen, who mentioned different concepts like electronics and computational thinking, I would recommend trying to incorporate these topics into your learning process. Electronics can be a valuable skill to learn, especially when working on projects that require wiring or electrical components. Additionally, developing computational thinking skills will help you better solve problems and understand complex systems.

Looking at students who have mentioned both similar and different knowledge, such as Katie and Andrea, it's apparent that some students are delving into areas like aluminum, battery, and problem-solving. I encourage you to explore these concepts further, as understanding material properties like aluminum and working with batteries can open up more project possibilities. Furthermore, developing problem-solving skills is essential in any field, and it will help you tackle challenges more effectively.

In summary, keep up the good work on the concepts you've mentioned this week, but also take the time to explore new topics mentioned by your classmates. Engage in brainstorming sessions, learn about electronics and computational thinking, and develop your problem-solving skills. This will not only enrich your projects but also help you grow as a well-rounded learner.

Best of luck, and keep up the great work!
