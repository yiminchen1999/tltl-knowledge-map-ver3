<Project summary>

It's great to see your enthusiasm for dissembling and understanding the intricacies of various components. You've highlighted the importance of perseverance and creativity while working with delicate and complex designs. It's fascinating to see how this process allowed you to connect real-world applications with textbook physics.

Your approach to learning by doing and embracing failure as a means of growth is commendable. Designing personally meaningful artifacts indeed helps in achieving a focused and driven state of mind.

You've successfully dissembled a small electric fan for a computer's CPU, identifying and listing its various parts. Your early design ideas centered around the spiritual aspect of circles and the potential uses of copper wire. Ultimately, you created a unique G-shaped wall decoration that appears differently when viewed from various angles.

Keep up the great work and continue exploring the world of design and creativity!


<Suggestions on collaboration and exploration opportunities>

Great job this week on focusing on elastic energy, elastic force, and geometry! It is good to see that you are exploring these concepts and applying them in your learning.

Comparing your knowledge to others who mentioned similar concepts, such as Chloe who also mentioned elastic energy and elastic force, I suggest both of you work together to dive deeper into these topics. You could research real-life applications of these concepts and discuss how they relate to your class projects. Collaborating with your classmates will help strengthen your understanding and provide different perspectives on the subject matter.

In comparison to other students who mentioned different concepts, like Amelia who focused on brainstorming and button, I recommend you also explore these areas to broaden your knowledge. Engaging with classmates who have different focuses will expose you to diverse ideas and help you develop a more well-rounded understanding of the course material.

Lastly, when comparing your knowledge to students who mentioned both similar and different concepts, like Juliana who mentioned computational thinking and geometry, it is a great opportunity to exchange ideas and learn from each other. You could discuss the applications of geometry in computational thinking, and Juliana could share her insights from her learning experiences. This type of collaboration will not only expand your knowledge but also foster a supportive learning environment within the class.

Keep up the good work, Mei, and remember to always be open to learning from your peers and exploring new concepts. Collaborating with your classmates will not only deepen your understanding of the material but also help you develop essential teamwork and communication skills. Keep pushing yourself to expand your knowledge, and don't hesitate to seek help or clarification when needed. Your dedication and curiosity will surely lead to success in your learning journey.
