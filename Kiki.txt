Dear Kiki,

Kiki, your project to transform an old flip phone into an art piece is a unique and creative way to explore the contrast between online and offline experiences. By using a tape collage to represent the noisy online conversations and soft, solid cotton with small objects to create a dreamlike environment for offline intimacy, you've effectively captured the differences between these two worlds.

It's great to see that Jackson's essay has prompted you to consider the relationship between objects and meaning in your own work. Your process of dissecting and repurposing the flip phone to create new meanings showcases your adaptability and willingness to embrace uncertainty in the creative process.

Your reflection highlights the importance of working neatly and being organized in future projects. Overall, your project is an excellent example of how everyday objects can be transformed into meaningful art pieces.

Keep up the great work, Kiki! Your creativity and thoughtfulness in this project are inspiring./

Well done this week on mentioning cotton, disassemble, and heart beat sensor in your knowledge matrix. You have shown a unique understanding of these concepts, which is commendable.

Comparing your knowledge with other students who mentioned the same concepts, you can further improve by focusing on the practical applications of these concepts. For instance, when discussing cotton, try to explore its properties and potential uses in a project. In the case of disassemble and heart beat sensor, you can research their roles in understanding the inner workings of devices and their importance in monitoring health, respectively.

When comparing to students who mentioned different knowledge concepts, it is essential to expand your understanding in various areas. For example, you can explore concepts like circuit and battery, which are crucial in electronics. Also, consider learning about brainstorm and problem-solving, as they are essential skills in the learning process.

Lastly, looking at students who mentioned both similar and different knowledge concepts, it's essential to find a balance between what you already know and what you could potentially learn. Continue exploring the concepts you are familiar with, while also incorporating new knowledge and skills from your peers. This approach can help you gain a more comprehensive understanding and make your learning experience more enriching.

Keep up the good work and continue to challenge yourself in your learning journey!
