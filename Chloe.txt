<Project summary>

Great job reflecting on the "Rethinking Repair" article and applying it to your assignment! You've recognized the importance of repurposing and reusing items, especially in today's fast-paced world with constantly changing technologies and products.

In your final project, you encountered some challenges, such as different sized springs causing the base to be slanted, and the sanitizer bottle being too heavy for the springs. It's impressive how you adapted and found a solution by sewing the springs to a cloth and attaching it to the base. For future projects, you noted the importance of using same-sized springs and a sturdier base to support heavier items.

Keep up the critical thinking and resourcefulness in your future projects!


<Suggestions on collaboration and exploration opportunities>

Great job this week! You've demonstrated knowledge in casting, debugging, elastic energy, and gears. Keep up the good work!

Comparing your knowledge matrix with Amelia's, who also mentioned casting and debugging, I suggest both of you explore more about the materials and techniques related to casting. Additionally, you can practice debugging in different programming languages to strengthen your problem-solving skills. 

Looking at Emma, who mentioned different knowledge concepts, such as geometry and laser cutting, I encourage you to explore these areas as they can broaden your understanding of design and fabrication processes. Collaborate with Emma to share your knowledge in casting and debugging, and learn from her experiences in geometry and laser cutting.

When comparing your knowledge with Mei, who mentioned both similar and different concepts, it's evident that you both share an interest in debugging and gears. Work together to improve your understanding of these topics, and share your individual knowledge in the different areas like elastic energy (mentioned by you) and computational thinking (mentioned by Mei).

Keep up the great work, and continue to learn from your classmates and share your knowledge. This collaborative approach will benefit everyone in the class.
