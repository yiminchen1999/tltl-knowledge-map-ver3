<Project summary>

Your post is a detailed account of your journey in repurposing a discarded microwave. You began by discussing the counter-cultural aspects of the project and touched upon the importance of a repair-centered ethics paradigm. You then provided an extensive list of components and tools used during the disassembling phase.

Your creative process involved exploring various ideas and testing their feasibility. Initially, you considered using the fan for different applications, but ultimately settled on creating an electric fan with a switch and decorations. You shared your attempts at generating energy using the fan, but eventually found that it didn't work as expected. You also experimented with adding visuals and sounds to the fan, with mixed results.

In the end, you successfully created a functional and decorative electric fan mounted on a recycled piece of wood. This project showcased your resourcefulness and determination to repurpose discarded materials, fostering a sustainable and environmentally-conscious mindset. Great work, Gabriela!


<Suggestions on collaboration and exploration opportunities>

Great job this week! You have done well in the areas of button, disassemble, and woodshop. Keep up the good work!

Compared to Amelia, Emma, and Chloe, who also mentioned button, you might want to explore circuit and compute, which they have mentioned. This could help you broaden your understanding of the connection between buttons and other electronic components. In addition, you can look into laser cut and recycle, as these concepts were mentioned by Mei and Lee, who also discussed disassemble. This will strengthen your knowledge on the disassembly process and its potential applications. 

For students who mentioned different knowledge, such as Larissa and Abigail, they focused on concepts like compute, learning process, and problem-solve. You can also consider diving into these areas to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the design and learning process. This will not only help you in grasping new concepts but also in enhancing your problem-solving skills.

Lastly, for students who mentioned both similar and different knowledge, like Juliana and Evelyn, they covered topics like button, disassemble, and compute. You can take inspiration from their knowledge matrix and work on incorporating compute into your learning, as it can be beneficial in understanding the link between the button and disassemble concepts you've already covered.

Keep up the good work, and continue exploring new concepts to broaden your knowledge!
