Dear Heidi,

Heidi, you started with the goal of maintaining the camera's integrity while salvaging its main components. In the disassembling phase, you were able to identify the various parts, and upon removing the main lens, you decided to convert the camera into a speaker. Drawing from your experience making Bluetooth speakers, you successfully made adjustments to the camera case and assembled the speaker.

You found reassembling the case challenging and wished you'd paid more attention during disassembly. Although you couldn't get the screen to turn on, you learned that repair is not just about restoring the original function, but also about creating something new. Embracing this perspective allowed you to enjoy the process and create a unique speaker within the camera case. Great job exploring new possibilities, Heidi!/

Great job this week! You've done well in focusing on "battery", "button", and "disassemble". Your knowledge matrix shows that you've mentioned these concepts during our class, which is a clear indication of your understanding and engagement.

Comparing your knowledge matrix with Eury, Sadia, and Helen, who also mentioned "button", I suggest you could work more on exploring "circuit" and "iterate" as these concepts are related and could deepen your understanding. Eury and Helen have included these concepts, so you may want to collaborate with them to learn more.

On the other hand, looking at the knowledge matrix of Ana Maria, Inara, and Kiki, who focused on different concepts like "cotton", "dissect", and "heart beat sensor", it would be beneficial for you to exchange ideas and learn from their diverse perspectives. This will help you to expand your knowledge and foster a more well-rounded understanding of the topics covered in class.

Lastly, considering students like Mariana and Andrea, who mentioned both similar and different concepts, you can learn from their experience in "screw" and "switch" as well as share your knowledge in "disassemble" and "battery". Collaborating with these students would be a great opportunity for cross-learning and to enhance your overall learning experience.

Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing your continued progress!
