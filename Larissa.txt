<Project summary>

Great job on disassembling the Dell Docking Station and exploring creative ways to repurpose its components! Your initial plan to create a pencil holder with a cute face was innovative, but it's understandable that you faced challenges with magnet use and adhering objects to the rubber surface. Your revised design shows adaptability and resourcefulness, incorporating new materials like tape, a salt pourer, and twist tie to resolve the initial issues. It's great to see you also include additional features like a cup for screws and a nose for the face. Although the handle attachment proved to be a challenge, it's a good learning experience.

Your reflection on the project highlights the importance of exercising creativity and considering the environmental impact of technology. It's admirable that you're thinking about these aspects and applying them to your work in tech.

Keep up the good work, and continue exploring ways to repurpose and reduce waste in the future!


<Suggestions on collaboration and exploration opportunities>

Great job this week on focusing on cardboard, circuit, and woodshop. You've shown a strong understanding of these concepts, and I encourage you to continue exploring and applying them.

Comparing your work to Amelia, Emma, and Chloe, all of you mentioned the circuit concept. However, Amelia and Chloe also discussed the button concept. I would suggest you to collaborate with them and learn more about how buttons can be integrated into your projects. Additionally, you and Emma both mentioned cardboard. Sharing ideas and techniques related to cardboard could help both of you expand your creativity.

When comparing your knowledge matrix to Mei, Lee, and Zoey who've mentioned different concepts, you may want to consider learning more about computational thinking, molding, and aluminum. These concepts can potentially enhance your projects and broaden your skillset. Collaborating with these students can help you gain a better understanding of these topics.

Lastly, comparing your work with Gabriela, Abigail, and Evelyn, you all have a mix of similar and different concepts. You, Gabriela, and Abigail all mentioned woodshop, while Evelyn focused on the fabric concept. You could consider learning from Evelyn and exploring how fabric can be utilized in your projects. Additionally, collaborating with Gabriela and Abigail on woodshop techniques can help all of you improve your skills in that area.

Keep up the good work, and remember to engage with your classmates to expand your knowledge and improve your projects!
